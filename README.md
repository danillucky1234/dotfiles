### What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.  

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.  

### My dotfiles includes:
- [.bashrc](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.bashrc)
- [.vim/](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/tree/main/.vim)
- [.vimrc](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.vimrc)
- [gnome terminal profile](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/gnome-terminal-profile.dconf)
- [neofetch config](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/neofetch)
- [i3](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/i3)
- [i3blocks](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/i3blocks)  

Also I have some scripts which help me to make my configs better:
- [lock screen](https://imgur.com/gallery/CNW9TQZ) - This script create snapshots of the monitors, blur them and add them as bg for lock screen. [This is what it looks like](https://cloud.degoo.com/share/7hZUJVQkmc3PuD5bIx5RVQ)
- [i3cpu](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3cpu) - This script scrapes the information about the 10 programs that load the system the most and displays the temperature of the computer in the tray
- [i3mem](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3mem) - This script scrapes the information about the 10 programs that consume the most memory and displays the total amount of used memory in the tray
- [i3vol](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3vol) - This script takes the thunder level on the computer and displays it in the tray
