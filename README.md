Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.  

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.  

### My dotfiles includes:
- [.bashrc](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.bashrc)
- [.vim/](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/tree/main/.vim)
- [.vimrc](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.vimrc)
- [gnome terminal profile](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/gnome-terminal-profile.dconf)
- [neofetch](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/neofetch)
- [i3](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/i3)
- [i3blocks](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/i3blocks)  

These files are needed to make i3blocks more beauty, it's a shell scripts:  
- [i3cpu](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3cpu)
- [i3mem](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3mem)
- [i3vol](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3vol)
