### What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.  

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.  

### My dotfiles includes:
#### Shells:
- [.bashrc](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.bashrc)

#### Editors:
- [.vim/](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/tree/main/.vim)
- [.vimrc](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.vimrc)

#### Terminal emulators:
- [gnome](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/gnome-terminal-profile.dconf)
- [kitty](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/kitty/kitty.conf)

#### WM:
- [i3](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/i3)

#### Another useful programs:
- [neofetch](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/neofetch)
- [i3blocks](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/i3blocks)  

### Also I have some scripts which help me to make my configs better:
- [lock screen](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/lock.sh) - This script create snapshots of the monitors, blur them and add them as bg for lock screen. [This is what it looks like](https://imgur.com/gallery/CNW9TQZ)
- [i3cpu](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3cpu) - This script scrapes the information about the 10 programs that load the system the most and displays the temperature of the computer in the tray
- [i3mem](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3mem) - This script scrapes the information about the 10 programs that consume the most memory and displays the total amount of used memory in the tray
- [i3vol](https://github.com/danillucky1234/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/i3vol) - This script takes the thunder level on the computer and displays it in the tray
